## Projects

Included are designs for three projects I have completed: a diet app, an e-commerce website for a musician and an e-commerce website for an artist. 
These were created with draw io and Moqups. I've also used Balsamic and Figma, and am currently working on a dress lookbook with Figma! 
Furthermore, as a social media officer for the Women in STEM society, I created over 65 designs with Canva. I've included some posts I enjoyed creating, plus some presentations I've made in my time.
