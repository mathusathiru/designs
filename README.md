## Projects

Included are designs for three projects I have completed: a diet app, an e-commerce website for a musician and an e-commerce website for an artist. 
These were created with draw io and Moqups. I've also used Balsamic and Figma, and am currently working on a dress lookbook with Figma! 

Furthermore, as a social media officer for the Women in STEM society, I created over 65 designs with Canva. You can view our page here (I created posts from the 22-23 academic year): [Link to Women in STEM Designs](https://www.linkedin.com/company/wistemessex/posts/?feedView=all&viewAsMember=true)
